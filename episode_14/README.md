# Episode 14: Generate AI videos with Bytedance Seedance and n8n

In this video, we show you how to use Bytedance’s Seedance to create AI videos. We created the ultimate n8n workflow — simply fill out a form with the video details you want, and the workflow automatically creates your desired outcome, with character and background consastency for multiple scenes. Plus, it renders videos in parallel, making the whole execution a lot faster.
